# fizzbuzz
My take on the infamous fizzbuzz exercise. Made a bit more fun.
Since fizzbuzz is so easy I decided to do it in a slightly crazy way, with unnecessary void pointers and crazy recasting.

fizz.c has the most beautiful line of code in my (quite short) career - line 25, nested recast just to shift an 8-char array one byte to the right. Oh boy, why did I even do that.
